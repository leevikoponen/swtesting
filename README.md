# Software Testing Coursework

Project repository for Tampere University's Software Testing course.

This differs from the official template repository by just using NPM to
depend on the provided code instead of forking from it as an actual template,
although the provided `package.json` makes doing so somewhat unergonomic.

Ideally this repository wouldn't even exist and I'm quite certain that outright
requiring use of external services like this is against school policy, but I
guess I wouldn't care about such details if I was just about to retire either.
